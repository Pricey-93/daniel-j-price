          Hi<span aria-hidden="true">üëã</span>, 
          I'm Dan. I'm a Software Developer who has worked professionally in a full-stack .NET environment,
          as well as the node.js environment, collaborating with clients and building and maintaining solutions from backend
          to frontend with clean, maintainable code. Owing to my unique background, I have become exceptional at solving 
          real world problems and have transformed into an adaptable team player, 
          with an eye for detail and a strong understanding of software development best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Journey started in the British Army where I served 7 years as a regular soldier, 
          building my character and developing important qualities like discipline, attention to detail,
          and organisational skills.
          After leaving, I levelled up further by gaining a first class degree in Computer Science and Japanese Studies
          from Oxford Brookes University before successfully landing a place as an English Teacher on the Japan Exchange and
          Teaching Programme (JET).
          Finally, I came back home to the UK to begin my career as Software Developer.
